# Tic-Tac-Toe

## This is the tic-tac-toe project from The Odin Project, i finally finished this project, it took me a long time and i had to do a lot of research to solve the problems that i came across, but now i finally managed to finish it, the hardest part of this project for me was to figure out how to apply the factory functions and module pattern concepts into the project, in terms of the game logics i had difficulty on the part of the game where i had to check the winner, but after some research i figured out. The game is still very simple, there is some functionalities that i want to implement in the future, like selecting names for the players and play against a AI.

# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a small tic-tac-toe game made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. In this little project I had to do a lot of research to solve the problems that I came across, but now I finally managed to finish it, the hardest part of this project for me was to figure out how to apply the factory functions and module pattern concepts into the project, in terms of the game logics I had difficulty on the part of the game where I had to check the winner, but after some research I figured out. The game is still very simple, there is some functionalities that I want to implement in the future, like selecting names for the players and play against a AI.

### How it works

The first turn is player X, when some field of the board is filled, the player's turn will change. There is a text above the game board that will be updated according to the game state telling who turn is it, who won, or if there was a tie, when someone wins or there is a tie, the board is blocked and it is necessary to click the restart button to start playing again, the restart button can be used at any point in the game.

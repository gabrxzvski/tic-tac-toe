This is the tic-tac-toe project from The Odin Project, this project has been the hardest one by far, i made a basic html and css structure just to test the javascript code on it, so far i'm struggling to implement the module pattern and factory functions, i want to write this code as clean as possible but i'm having a hard time structuring the code to make it look clean and readable, i will continue to work on it.
